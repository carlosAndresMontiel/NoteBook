# NoteBook

**NoteBook** was created to be an API REST to store notes when studing. It allows to create a note with a title, content, an example and a link associated to the sourse web site, and also associate the note to a category.

## Version 1.0.0

Basic capabilities to store info in a mysql database using **Sequilize** to manage queries. 
The **prismaImplementation branch**  was created to study the syntaxis of **Prisma**, but there are many things to rectify on this project.

## Version 1.1.0
this version is in the designing stage and it will be considered as a personal web site to share the progress of my projects as well as share my study notes and create articles to summarize the knowlege aquired.
